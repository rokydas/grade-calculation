# Grade Calculation

It is a website for students to calculate their grades providing their numbers of many subjects. I have listed its features below: 

- Varsity students can get a semester grade providing how many courses, every course's name, credit, and number(%) of a semester. 
For getting the grade, at first he/she has to input how many courses are in that semester. Then he/she has to fill up a form including course name, credit, and number. After providing this, if he clicks the 'submit' button, he can get his grade. 

- PSC students, JSC students, SSC students, and HSC students can get also their grades providing their numbers of all subjects.
